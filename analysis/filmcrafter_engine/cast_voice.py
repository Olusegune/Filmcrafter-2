"""Custom voices with ElevenLabs, right inside a film: give each person a voice (pick one from your ElevenLabs library, design a new one from a description, or clone one from
your own recording) and have the app speak a written line in it as that person's voice for a shot.

  voice/cast.json   {"people": {key: {"name", "voice_id", "voice_name", "model", "stability", "similarity", "style", "speed", "made": "library|design|clone"}}}
  voice/_previews/  the audio of designed-voice previews (so you can hear them)
  voice/_generated/ lines already spoken (the same voice, model and words are never paid for twice)

What can spend, and the rules (see `paidops.py`, which every provider's paid calls are meant to share):
  - These actions can use your ElevenLabs plan and are refused by the engine unless the call says `confirmed: true`: `speak`, `preview` (characters and credits, shown first),
    `design` (an amount ElevenLabs does not publish, so the call must also say `unknown_cost_accepted: true`), `design_save` and `clone` (each takes one voice slot).
    The screen asks first; the engine does not trust that. `clone` also needs `consent: true`: permission to use a voice and permission to spend are separate and never merged.
  - Free: `status`, `library`, `set`, `clear`, `estimate`, `takes`, `use_take`, `sample`, `ledger`, `ledger_resolve`, `set_limit`.
  - Every spending call is written to `voice/ledger.json` before it is sent (prepared, confirmed, submitted) and settled after (completed, refused, failed before submission, uncertain).
    An estimate is never recorded as an actual: the actual amount is filled in only if ElevenLabs' own reply carries it.
  - A request is retried automatically only when ElevenLabs said "slow down" (429) or the connection was never made. A timeout after sending, or a 5xx, is recorded as *uncertain*,
    explained, and never repeated by FilmCrafter on its own; the person checks ElevenLabs' usage page and marks it "not charged" or "charged".
  - A line already spoken in the same voice is a file on disk: it is free and makes no request.
A spoken line is attached through `voiceover.attach` like any recording (so the shot is lengthened to hold it, a recording it replaces is archived, never deleted) and is marked
`source: elevenlabs` so it can be told from your own voice and replaced by it later. Cloning needs a plan with instant voice cloning.
