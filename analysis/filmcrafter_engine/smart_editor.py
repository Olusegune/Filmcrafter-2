"""The Smart Editor: suggestions for the cut that explain themselves, can be previewed, and change nothing until you accept them.

What it does, plainly: it reads the cut, the dialogue, the beats and directions YOU wrote in the Performance Director, and each take's own length, and proposes a few edits by explainable rules. Every
proposal says what it would change, why that may help, which clips it touches, and shows a real before and after preview (the film's own export of the part). Accepting applies it as ONE change
(one undo takes it back); rejecting keeps it away. It is free, local and deterministic: nothing is sent anywhere, nothing is rendered by a provider, and the same cut gives the same suggestions.

The rules (a deliberately small, testable set; a suggestion is a reading to accept or refuse, never a verdict):
  tighten    a clip with spoken lines that runs well past the time the words need (about 155 words a minute plus a breath between lines): suggest ending it a little after the last word.
             NEVER suggested where the pause is yours: a beat you wrote that falls in the tail, or "Hold the reaction longer" or "More hesitant" switched on for the shot. Those are listed as kept, with
             the reason, so you can see the editor left them alone on purpose.
  react      a clip of someone listening straight after another person spoke: suggest giving it a little more time (only if the take has more picture, or it is a still).

Recipes set how tight or generous those two are. Three are built; the others in the list are named so you can see what is not there yet and are not offered. "Ask" understands a few plain requests
("tighten this scene", "give the audience more time on her reaction") by keywords, says when it does not understand, and never guesses.

  <film>/edit/proposals.json   which suggestions you rejected or accepted (so a rejected one stays away), nothing else
